# General purpose frequency generator

	- work in progress -

*EAGLE* is a general purpose frequency generator with two channels. It is designed in Creator 4.1 from Cypress and for the PSoC 5LP from Cypress. It is meant for generating bursts at a fixed frequency (default: 5MHz) where only slight frequency adjustments are necessary. It allows adjusting the frequency in a range of +/- 5% via USBUART or a Bluetooth modem.
